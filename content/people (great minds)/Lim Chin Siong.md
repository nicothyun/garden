- Detained without trial in 1963, which ended his political career
- In 1955, Lim Yew hock, knowing that Lim was an overwhelmingly popular politician and likely winner of the next General Election, worked with British colonial officials and Lee to have Lim arrested on false charges.
- Unable to find a basis for a formal conviction, they detained him without trial until the election of Lim's PAP in 1959 forced his released.
- Underwent huge discrimination, detention and oppression that Lim endured between his return to Singapore in 1949 and his emergence as a trade union leader in 1954

*"During this period of time, I sort of neglected my study by way of immersing myself in reading voraciously and indulging in activities other than attending school. I read a lot of novels and poems written by Russian writers. I buried myself in books on philosophy, history and politics.  
  
*I then realised that as a human being, one should not only live for oneself. If the country or nation and the people are yet to be free, an individual will not be free either. If a nation or the people wish to be free, the most oppressed and the most exploited must rise and be united, and struggle till the end. Perhaps you may say that, as a consequence of my reading those books, I started to be slanted towards socialism and accepted it as a beautiful vision of humankind.”*
(Lim 2014)


1949 August:
- Special Branch detained Lim without trial for nearly a week. No communist links were found. 
- Unable to elicit a confession of communism, Special Branch resorted to torture and beatings.

“_Here lies an ordinary soul. Throughout his life, he has been trying all his best to dedicate himself to the most beautiful ideal of mankind, namely, to strive for the realisation of a peaceful and democratic society, where there is no exploitation and oppression of man by man, no poverty, no illness; where everyone is allowed to give full play to his potential!_”  
  
These words are reminiscent of the time-honoured statement by the hero in the well-known Russian revolutionary novel _How the Steel was Tempered._

- Joined Anti-British League (ABL)

- Lim too had moved on from the ABL, for he had discovered a far more effective and practical way of resisting colonialism and improving the lives of his fellow countrymen: labour activism and the trade unions. 

**early political career**
three themes:
(1) historical inevitability of decolonisation
(2) concept of self-determination
(3) nonviolent and peaceful strikes to reform the system


illustrates how economic and political self determination were intertwined

It is this paradox which lies at the heart of both of Lim’s detentions. In both cases, his painstaking manoeuvring to adhere to non-violent constitutional methods forced the government to step outside the democratic process and detain him on invented security grounds.


In the latter narrative, they were ethnic nationalists, seeking to impose their cultural agenda upon the country to the detriment of other communities. During Lim’s first imprisonment, and again after the PAP split in 1961, Lee Kuan Yew would imply, insinuate, and later outright accuse Lim of being a tool of international communism and being a Chinese chauvinist (Lee 1962). Today, this line of attack continues via the official “Singapore Story,” in which the left are portrayed as having been led astray by a false god of Marxist ideology and also promoting Chinese interests over Singapore’s other ethnic communities, with no apparent contradiction in the two arguments.


"But most of the time, I was of the view that this form of punishment was more brutal than the Japanese style of torture. The Japanese soldier would slaughter you with a sword, or shoot you with a gun and caused your instant death.  Detention without trial is a chronic, long term and gradual destruction of a human being.  
  
"Such form of punishment is crueller than the punishment meted out to criminals. If a criminal is guilty of arson and murder, he will be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.  At least he has a destination in life: If his appeal against death penalty fails, he will have an appointment with God."

You have no opportunity of being released until you destroy your own self by succumbing to the demand of your political opponent.
