**Waka poetry**  
5-7-7-5 syllables, Waka syllabus is part of heian court and literature, very complicated

**themes in the literature** 
- *moni no aware:* sadness of things, impermanence, things that don't last long, appreciation of beauty  
- cycles of karmic retribution  
- spirit possession - lady rokujo gives eerie gothic tone where illness caused by vengeful spirits  
women and female anger seen as dangerously disruptive  
kills lady aoi - genji's first wife - and then lady murusaki  


**[[women writers]]**  
unusual to have major japanese classic to be written by women  
women writers declined in end of heian period until late modern century as a more militaristic samurai culture replaced it
