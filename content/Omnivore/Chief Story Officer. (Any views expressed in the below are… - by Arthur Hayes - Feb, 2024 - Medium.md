> The story you tell yourself about certain actions informs your perception of their risk. I will call this the narrative. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-cryptohayes-medium-com-chief-story-officer-3159-e-749-a-15-18dcf87cda5#3e26557c-592a-4fcb-b287-c0b0ecdb5178)  ^3e26557c

> Because you make more money being long than short, optimism will win over pessimism during the cycle. It’s just how the human brain is wired. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-cryptohayes-medium-com-chief-story-officer-3159-e-749-a-15-18dcf87cda5#66fcf807-e7b8-4ce3-9a6d-55a8c3e78f6e)  ^66fcf807

> The better and more concise the story, the faster it will spread. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-cryptohayes-medium-com-chief-story-officer-3159-e-749-a-15-18dcf87cda5#3e672e8f-5cbb-4b15-a272-c36b829be74b)  ^3e672e8f

> Our job is to ascertain which project has the best probability of success given the story vertical. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-cryptohayes-medium-com-chief-story-officer-3159-e-749-a-15-18dcf87cda5#3f48da70-9336-4c6b-b22f-a340538e7c2c)  ^3f48da70

> I would rather invest in a token with a perceived probability of success of 0.01% that has a story in the growth phase of virality than a token with a perceived probability of success of 50% but has a story that has reached the common knowledge phase. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/https-cryptohayes-medium-com-chief-story-officer-3159-e-749-a-15-18dcf87cda5#cd9e218a-367a-439a-b450-5a1f8750e2db)  ^cd9e218a

> But the only way to 100x my money with a token that has a perceived probability of success at 50% is that the actual results, in whatever format is relevant to that project, are so amazing that growth comes from observed results rather than a rising perception of future success.
