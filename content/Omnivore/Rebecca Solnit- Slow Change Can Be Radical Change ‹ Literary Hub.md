## Highlights

> Most truths are like that, easy to hear or recite, hard to live in the sense that slowness is hard for most of us, requiring commitment, perseverance, and return after you stray.

> You want tomorrow to be different than today, and it may seem the same, or worse, but next year will be different than this one, because those tiny increments added up. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/rebecca-solnit-slow-change-can-be-radical-change-literary-hub-18d2eed6b14#833b93ab-2fe7-4fcc-9f5b-663e9950e375)  ^833b93ab

> Who cares if we can win, man? We’re just unpacking boxes. You do things step by step.” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/rebecca-solnit-slow-change-can-be-radical-change-literary-hub-18d2eed6b14#b374b1ad-5edb-4c3e-9390-38906248eed4)  ^b374b1ad

> To be able to see change is to be able to make change. I’m an advocate for slowness, not in the sense of dragging your feet or delaying your reaction but in the sense of scaling your perception to to perceive the events unfolding, because I’m an advocate for making change.
