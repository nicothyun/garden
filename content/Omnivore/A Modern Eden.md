## Highlights

> In 1848, the discovery of gold in the Sacramento Valley drew hordes of prospective gold miners to San Francisco and the surrounding area. The promise was (somewhat) true – they ultimately extracted $2B of precious metal during the Gold Rush.

In cyclical pattern, Silicon Valley tech boom also drew hordes of people to San Fran in 2000s to 2020s.

> the software revolution attracted a new population of settlers who realized this potential by building platforms and networks. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/a-modern-eden-18b619a61a4#627e08d1-faab-4612-b148-b9ae2c686e7e)  ^627e08d1

> AGI behaves like a God in more ways than not – implied immortality, the facade of limitless knowledge. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/a-modern-eden-18b619a61a4#a36f07e0-dca5-40ad-b0a0-45542da0d8e0)  ^a36f07e0

> This depiction of California is intensely idealized, though perhaps that reveals my current sentiment. In most places, playing the game according to the rules is rewarded, and the game is already defined. What California rewards is the creation of new systems entirely.
