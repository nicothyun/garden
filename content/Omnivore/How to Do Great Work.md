## Highlights

> The first step is to decide what to work on. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#ded33efb-51a8-4439-84a4-4f85fdb6c08b)  ^ded33efb

> The way to figure out what to work on is by working. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#6e3b34d2-d27b-45ab-9436-707bde08fd24)  ^6e3b34d2

On hindsight, 20 year old me seems to have subconsciously manifested that ethos of doing and trying, and finding what sticks.  

> Develop a habit of working on your own projects. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#fc2e4dae-ee69-452d-9fe7-5b95da66c387)  ^fc2e4dae

> But always preserve excitingness. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#87c82386-03da-4ad7-80d5-28daa61d40e3)  ^87c82386

> There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let it have its way, will also show you what to work on. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#d698cadf-d0c2-4d49-82be-d2873bff8ebf)  ^d698cadf

> The next step is to notice them. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#1c9bbc9b-40a7-405f-89e0-213b5a5a300e)  ^1c9bbc9b

> That's why it's essential to work on something you're deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#cd0c0117-e8ef-4351-a732-3f99ccb86876)  ^cd0c0117

> The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#fd3379c2-7923-4593-ad2c-9b0468c870b9)  ^fd3379c2

> You need to take action. But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#da89bea4-ac4f-4a33-bd43-620aa685b9ab)  ^da89bea4

> The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you'll be productive. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#960d2227-7f8b-4d8a-9b52-0250582bbb7e)  ^960d2227

> The best way to do this is to make something you yourself want. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#febf55a8-529e-4622-935b-f016f80a9a9a)  ^febf55a8

> There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you're trying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics, other people's wishes, eminent frauds. But if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof against all of them. If you're interested, you're not astray. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#a06039e8-6f44-4761-b90b-0d7976526cee)  ^a06039e8

> The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements you can describe in advance. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#1c04e41a-03e0-4bed-b55e-8c47f29f41bd)  ^1c04e41a

> I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#f77bdbc3-190b-4ab7-a4b3-2875f4c893bc)  ^f77bdbc3

> Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be more work than you expected. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#bc20c6e7-fa4a-42c6-b733-4ab6aedc80bd)  ^bc20c6e7

> Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#1eff984c-eef9-4273-aee2-4e53ec3ff2ce)  ^1eff984c

> If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most people who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon: the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#9e711124-861e-4e99-bde8-5b8f743456b2)  ^9e711124

> Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't know what you're aiming for. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#dee1d900-33f6-4dca-b530-abf56392b057)  ^dee1d900

> There may be some jobs where it's an advantage to be cynical and pessimistic, but if you want to do great work it's an advantage to be optimistic, even though that means you'll risk looking like a fool sometimes. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#6f949ac3-4273-41e4-ac9b-3c0d437bf087)  ^6f949ac3

> Great work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself. It's usually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middle of working on something, ask which choice is more consistent. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#1ff1948c-06dd-4fad-807a-a260ccb548be)  ^1ff1948c

> Whereas some of the very best work will seem like it took comparatively little effort, because it was in a sense already there. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#fba7251a-63c0-4702-804e-96888432ba5a)  ^fba7251a

> I've never liked the term "creative process." It seems misleading. Originality isn't a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkers throw off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an angle grinder throwing off sparks. They can't help it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#b446c1e7-d09f-4002-b0af-97c1243217ea)  ^b446c1e7

> Talking or writing about the things you're interested in is a good way to generate new ideas. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#de54d771-9bbf-4471-934f-ab29bc41b472)  ^de54d771

> Don't divide your attention _evenly_ between many topics though, or you'll spread yourself too thin. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#6aea698e-1098-40f0-8130-6337a594a07f)  ^6aea698e

> One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than solutions is that problems are bigger bets. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#ad9f96d2-fa80-4176-a7ab-fe9bb915575a)  ^ad9f96d2

> It's better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit on a lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The initial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start lots of small things. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#befb3bec-9074-4d12-887a-e135c6974c71)  ^befb3bec

> Take as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk is proportionate to reward, so don't look for certainty, but for a bet with high expected value. If you're not failing occasionally, you're probably being too conservative. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#4ecedc9f-f7f0-4dd4-a4ab-1038151521db)  ^4ecedc9f

> Use the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages of age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy, time, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge, efficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some of the latter when young and keep some of the former when old. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#53814ef2-aeae-4dde-863d-cf22b5d46b0a)  ^53814ef2

> One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from one field into another. History is so full of chance discoveries of this type that it's probably worth giving chance a hand by deliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideas from quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#aaf561ff-5d92-4c70-a6d3-7b813500668d)  ^aaf561ff

> Seek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can't be done alone, and even if you're working on one that can be, it's good to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#8bd6dc3b-a8af-4d6b-bc3d-9d0cb03aea47)  ^8bd6dc3b

> If you choose work that's pure, its very difficulties will serve as a refuge from the difficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism, it's a very productive form of it, and one that has been used by some of the greatest minds in history. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#8ef9f23c-0307-43b3-968c-2fc917966cd6)  ^8ef9f23c

> Competition can be an effective motivator, but don't let it choose the problem for you; don't let yourself get drawn into chasing something just because others are. In fact, don't let competitors make you do anything much more specific than work harder. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#f5f5fda2-9751-40dc-922d-b6afe10ecffb)  ^f5f5fda2

> Don't worry about being presumptuous. You don't have to tell anyone. And if it's too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people have worse problems than that. In fact you'll be lucky if it's the worst problem you have. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/how-to-do-great-work-18de572c1dd#ab471051-e85b-4766-ba1c-2b3a982d4736)  ^ab471051
