## Highlights

> My apartment is full of books I haven’t read, and others I read so long ago that I barely remember what’s in them. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-paris-review-in-this-essay-i-will-on-distraction-the-paris-r-18b5cf6fc29#64b81039-97be-4378-9138-7465936953f9)  ^64b81039

> What is distraction? Maybe it is just the need to be diverted: from the direction you originally set out on, from what it was you thought you wanted to do. After all, to desire something requires projecting yourself into the future—how do you know you’ll still want it when you get there? And along the way there are so many attractions, way stations, spots of time.

> In fact, at times they seem nearly maniacal in their thirst for knowledge. But isn’t the idea that\] they are potentially interested in everything a kind of curse, something worse than indifference? As fast as they find a passion, they can be drawn away from it. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-paris-review-in-this-essay-i-will-on-distraction-the-paris-r-18b5cf6fc29#daa97982-3924-4f01-a372-3fca4d535c9c)  ^daa97982

> Their curiosity has no staying power—it’s just the dirty runoff of a Zeitgeist that tells them to improve themselves, improve the human race. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-paris-review-in-this-essay-i-will-on-distraction-the-paris-r-18b5cf6fc29#fcd7cee3-f8b4-4c0e-b90e-1a20f00da980)  ^fcd7cee3

Our Zeitgeist of the time encourages us to be productive and to always be producing results and outcomes.

> Now that I no longer work a forty-hour-a-week job, I tell many people I am writing a book. It is going along, I say, but slowly. How is it that so many chores, parties, trips, assignments, and plainly wasted hours intervene? Not everyone is distracted from their most cherished goals. But I think everyone is distracted from something—it is desire’s shadow, trailing behind our self-presentations.

> The fugitive moments in between our lifelong undertakings, whatever their ultimate worth, may be what we are searching for all along. Maybe we are distracted because we are still learning how to live.
