in the realm of money, before crypto, all movement of money required someone's permission?? 
- cash is permissionless but it is limited by distance. 
- government is trying to eradicate cash.

money is fundamental to our human existence and we should care about its quality and character and WHO controls it. 

as long as you behave and subscribe to the social contracts of the society, the permission will be granted. 

crypto as an act of rebellion against the system; rebellion against permission. 
- Crypto is a technology of individual freedom and a declaration of financial independence.
- crypto is not a rebellion or freedom from permission and rules but simply a preference for rules which are objective and transparent. 

jaded at the rules of men that governs money, which are created by fallible and often corrupt people in power.
