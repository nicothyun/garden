here's a thoreau's derivative and maybe an ode to him:  

*i quit my job and went into the wilderness because i wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if i could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when i came to die, discover that i had not lived.* 

i quit my corporate job, to find myself. 

three months later, i still feel lost. 

perhaps, this is one of the many faceless, privileged millennial tantrums in this algorithmic sea of voices. throughout the four months, i am in a cyclical slump where i weave through fleeting moments of exuberance and then moments of downcast. 

phuket was the first of stop in my cyclical waves of emotions. i broke my finger, wore a heavy cast throughout the hottest, mind-breaking and record-breaking summer month of singapore. the heat was sticky, the humidity impenetrable, my mind fragile. 

one never knows the velocity of their negative emotions before it completely overwhelms the bearer and its surrounding. the past months leading up to phuket and to the final days at my job, i been awashed and overwhelmed with crippling emotions. i felt a torrent of relief, gratitude, support and fear. a long dragged chapter has finally ended and yet, being a compulsive planner, i was fearful of what's to come and fearful of wasting time. 

where i came from, time could be quantified and monetized, trimmed down to material metrics of maximizing profits and revenue efficiency. in that strange alternate dimension and timeline, time is a ruler and it measured my worth, identity and wealth. in that strange world, i was a running production line, endlessly chasing after a vanity desire to produce output after output. the output was to be produced in the least amount of time and inversely with the highest of quality. it operated twenty four hours 7 days a week. my human body was expected to work like an industrial clockwork and was pitted against the robotic lines. i wanted to escape from it all and so i jumped. 

yet in this other dimension where i leaped into, time - so precious, fleeting and yet elastic and expansive - was a rubber. it spanned and spanned through mundane moments and danced with a rhythm of its own.

**abrupt stop in music** (find nice instrumental or commercial free music)**

in escaping the zeitgeist of my times and in my derivative Frankenstein means to escape the plight of not becoming "one of the mass of men leading lives of quiet desperation", i took upon another narrative of the times. the other narrative was to lead a life on the roads, to take a sabbatical pursuing yoga teaching and chasing after diving certifications and to pursue my hobbies (what hobbies?) with outcomes of being able to quantify the break in the future. 

horrible? i am a terrible co-opt. privileged, i leap from another world only to bring the mindsets i subconsciously learn into another world. i co-opted (anti?) capitalist, anti-consumerist messages, while paradoxically consuming and purchasing the very messages i avowed to reject.

perhaps, 
i am making excuses. i run and escape to far flung worlds in the pretense of lacking enough experiences. it is after all a much easier endeavour to live life and paths that have been carved and trodden by the masses. i am a gambler after the heart but i fear my own.  

i fruitlessly dream of the imagined, the unborn, the creative drafts shelved and dusted in the recesses of my head to gain posterity, or to earn wealth before they even make it out the mind chamber. i am the farmer, counting my chickens before they hatch. the ideas infant, the work undone and the eggs left rotting and decaying. i am afraid of pursuing creation in its purest sense - to create for the sake because i am afraid i will never be good enough. 

jean rhys once wrote "one needs alot of courage to live."

helpless. lost. fearful of what's to come. privileged. observing for the passing of seasons. i want to return to those childlike, adolescents days of creating art, writing, producing derivatives and fan fictions & fan mix. creating for its sake and enjoying the process. 

i found myself, lost myself again and again. i seek so anxiously to be shapen and developed into a finished clay, while i subject myself to many influences to be played on; it is all dissipation. i am learning to become more unhinged, to care less about what i or society thinks and to figure things out while learning to let go and listening to my heart. 

phuket was the first of stop but not the last.
