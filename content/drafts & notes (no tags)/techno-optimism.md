**TLDR:** Believes new technologies benefits will far outweigh the costs and only innovation can help solve the problems and inevitable consequences of human advancement. 

How do we get to a point where [clean energy]() sources can replace fossil fuels?
- moving towards electric energy (battery energy)-> solar or renewable energy

**dilemma and hidden premise?:**
- capitalism or common day society has an inherent belief or drive in advancement. 
- finite energy and resources and emphasis on growth and advancement, where techno-optimism and belief in new technologies is intended to solve these problems caused by "progress" v.s. 
- man adopting another alternative paradigm: de-growth. 
- another interesting concept: [luxurious communism]()

**nay-sayers:** 
- doesn't address the distribution of new technologies -> how new technologies are distributed in an equitable way
	- e.g distribution of vaccines during COVID had power & money imbalances where developing countries were "left behind"
- innovation can radically transform the ways people live their lives, but history tells us that this change is not always for the better. 

**things & questions to think about:**
- ethics of innovation
- proponents of techno-optimism are often billionaire class who are the ones that benefit the most from maintaining status quo and this current lifestyle 
- the current world we live in which allows billionaires to accrue such wealth is the very system that is exacerbating the problems we are facing?
