After my last letter, I started my career sabbatical and it has been almost three months. 

In the past three months, I went on a 31-days backpacking trip where I trekked and clocked an average of 20 kilometers a day in Japan & Korea. I loved walking because in walking, I had felt like I truly explored and unraveled the hidden secrets of a city, with its crooks and crannies. Along the way, I lost two kilograms off my body from the meandering summer strolls. 

ferry hopped my way to Busan from Fukuoka.
