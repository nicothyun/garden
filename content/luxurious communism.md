[@frederic lordon]([In search of luxurious communism , by Frédéric Lordon (Le Monde diplomatique - English edition, November 2021)](https://mondediplo.com/outside-in/luxury-communism#:~:text=The%20idea%20of%20luxurious%20communism%2C%20then%2C%20must%20mean,minimal%20number%20of%20objects%20that%20we%20will%20keep.))
*"The idea of luxurious communism, then, must mean rejecting the idea that this reduction would mean a loss of beauty in our material life — because we will still have one. And, to be more precise, the aim will be to maximise the beauty of the minimal number of objects that we will keep."*
