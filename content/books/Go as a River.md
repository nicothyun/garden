<p>
pg 7: I knew the town of Iola when it woke each morning to fragrant breakfasts and bustling farms and ranches, how the sunrise illuminated the east side of Main then inched uptown, across the train tracks and schoolyard, to ignite the tiny church's one round red and blue stained glass window... I knew all the shortcuts and townsfolk and the oldest gnarled tree consistently producing the sweetest peaches in my family's orchard. And I knew, perhaps more than most, the sadness of this place. 
<p>
pg 8: The landscapes of our youths create us, and we carry them within us, storied by all the gave and stole, in who we become. 
<p>
pg 10: But I've come to understand how the exceptional lurks beneath the ordinary, like the deep and mysterious world beneath the surface of the sea.  
<p>
pg 30: She, like I, like women throughout the ages, knew the value of employing silence as a guard dog to her truth. By showing on the surface only a small fraction of her interior, a woman gave men less to plunder.  
<p>
pg 92: I drifted in and out of sleep, my strange torpor beleaguered by anxiety about laziness and choices and the unfamiliar noises surrounding the hut. 
<p>
pg 95: There was beauty to the chaos. Every piece or life here had it's role in the eternal business of living. I felt small and unnecessary but not entirely unwelcome.
<p>
pg 166: I'm sure the boy was remembered as a hero and the daughter as a rogue, but the same wild boldness to walk out this front door had driven them both to elsewhere. 
<p>
pg 168: I wanted to tell him I was ready for him now. I wanted to tell him I knew the pain of displacement and how sorry- how deeply, profoundly, unutterably sorry - I was that I had given him away, that I hadn't known any other way to save him. 
<p>
pg 174: "I am not saying it's the same. I'm just saying the government can do anything it damm well pleases, and people suffer," she said. "And we don't learn one scrap from history."
<p>
pg 176: As the deputy stepped back and waved me across the bridge, I wondered at the limits of progress and if we'd every know when we hit them. 
<p> 
pg 194: Eventually, I gave up the notebooks and novels I pointlessly carried in the diaper bag and stopped longing for the life I might have had. Instead, I surrendered to motherhood. The choice was motherhood or madness. 
<p>
pg 223: Strength, I had learned, was like this littered forest floor, built of small triumphs and infinite blunders, sunny hours followed by sudden storms that tore it all down. We are one and all alike if for no other reason than the excruciating and beautiful way we grow piece by unpredictable piece, falling, pushing from the debris, rising again, and hoping for the best.
