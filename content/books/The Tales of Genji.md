characters, structure & plot 
---
**prince genji**  
shining prince and he is the ideal man of the heian period 
genji is a son of emperor and low ranking concubine so he will never be emperor  
narrator also shows him doing bad things  
  
**challenges of reading genji**  
no clear climax, ends abruptly  
endless chapters, like a modern day taiwanese soap opera   
language is distant from modern japanese. native japanese speakers can't read this. translations to modern japanese.  
no names and referred to by ranks and titles.  
  
**waka poetry***  
5-7-7-5 syllables, waka syllabus is part of heian court and literature, very complicated  
based on allusions. part of artistry is taking well known tropes and fitting into the character situation.  

**themes in the literature** 
---
- *moni no aware:* sadness of things, impermanence, things that don't last long, appreciation of beauty  
- cycles of karmic retribution  
- spirit possession - lady rokujo gives eerie gothic tone where illness caused by vengeful spirits. women and female anger are seen as dangerously disruptive  because lady rokujo kills lady aoi - genji's first wife - and then lady murusaki  

**[[Women Writers]]**  
---
unusual to have major japanese classic to be written by women  
women writers declined in end of heian period until late modern century as a more militaristic samurai culture replaced it

author is a highly educated and lady in waiting to empress shoshi - writes take of genji to entertain the ladies in court. circulated widely during her lifetime  
  
most women of her times were writing poetry and fiction  
  
considered rude to refer to high ranking ppl by their name. in jap concept then, you don't have a specific name throughout your lifetime  
  
not unusual for writers to have pen name and nickname  
  
high ranking women not supposed to show face in public. images of her were created after she died  
  
legend: she was inspired to write tales of genji after she was inspired by the reflections of the moon on the water
