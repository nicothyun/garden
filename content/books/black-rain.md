**4/5** rating.

Located in [[Hiroshima, Japan]].

"Black Rain" depicts the aftermath of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Throughout the book, the residents gradually makes sense of what happened; it was a war bomb but unlike any other that had come before. 

There is no overt criticism from the writer and narrator for it places the focus on the residents' suffering, shock and their complex emotional landscape. The narrator paints the pain and suffering of the affected in a matter-of-fact tone, speaking as it is, showcasing the grotesque and factual horrors of the bombing aftermath on its people. 

The atomic bomb scarred and transformed the physical and emotional topography of Hiroshima. The victims suffer threefold: first, in tepid starvation and silent anger at the Imperial Japan Army. It is as if the residents is accustomed to war, where it is bewilderingly commonplace to mobilize thousands of middle school students to assist with building demolition. Building demolition program was intended to create firebreaks to stop the spread of fires caused by air raids. 

The victims suffer a second time, when the landmark atomic bomb fell on August 6; they endured painful agony and drawn-out deaths as thousands of residents were murdered, burned, disfigured and diseased from radiation sickness. Pus grew, maggots infested their open wounds, their appetite waned, their hair fell out, their teeth dropped, and they succumbed to their deaths.

They suffered a third time, burdened with guilt and shame as they were socially discriminated against and labeled as hibakusha. Guilt arose from surviving the war while their common men did not. Shame from being a recovering patient, where even in good health, the certainty of marriage and employment becomes unclear.

The book is a beautiful, open letter against war and nuclear weapons.

pg 11: Black Rain is a portrait of a group of human beings; of the death of a great city; of a nation crumbling into defeat. It is a picture of the Japanese mind that tells more than many sociological studies. Yet more than this, it is a statement of a philosophy. Although that philosophy, in its essence, is neither pessimistic nor optimistic, it seems to me to be life affirming. Dealing with the grimmest of subjects, the work is not, in the end, depressing, for the author is ultimately concerned with life rather than with death, and with an overall beauty that transcends ugliness of detail.

pg 21: August 6: Hiroshima is a burnt out city, a city of ashes, a city of death, a city of destruction, the heaps of corpses a mute protest against the inhumanity of war.

pg 24: I remembered a photograph of oil tanks burning in Singapore that I had once seen. It had been taken just after the Japanese army had brought about the fall of the city, and the scene was so horrifying that I wondered at the time whether such things were really justified.

pg 35: Thundery black clouds had borne down on us from the direction of the city, and the rain from them had fallen in streaks the thickness of a fountain pen. It had stopped almost immediately. It was cold, cold enough to make one shiver although it was midsummer.

pg 51: As I got up from my prone position, the first thing to meet my gaze was a great, an enormous, column of cloud. In its texture, it reminded me of cumulo-nimbus clouds I had seen in photographs taken after the Great Kant Earthquake. But this one trailed a single, thick leg beneath it, and reached up high into the heavens. Flattening out at its peak, it swelled out fatter and fatter like an opening mushroom.

pg 56: A woman with her belongings and a child loaded on a baby carriage, who was engulfed in a sudden wave of humanity that crushed the baby carriage and felled her on top of it, so that twenty or thirty others coming behind her toppled like dominoes in their turn. The cries at that moment had to be heard to be believed.

pg 59: Every year on the anniversary of the day the bomb fell, why don't we have the same things for breakfast as we had that August 6? I can remember what we had that day all right. Very clearly, I can.

pg 68: Before the war, Hiroshima was known as a place with plenty of produce both from the sea and the country, and although it was so big, there were no slums. But living in Hiroshima I realized, as they say, that in a long drawn out war it's case of the larger the town, the shorter its inhabitants go of food. And I realized, too, that war's a sadistic killer of human beings, young and old, men and women alike.

pg 83: Suddenly, all the things we had done up to now seemed to me so much children's play, and my own life, too, a toy life.

pg 87: The sky was dusty with the smoke from the fires. There was no water in the taps, so I made Yasuko wash her hands at the pool in the garden, but the marks would not come off. She said they were made by the black rain, and they were firmly stuck on the skin. They were not tar, nor black paint, but something of unknown origins.

pg 142: The mirror showed me that the infected place on the side of my nose was gaping open and had dried up crisp and hard. Life was one depressing thing after another. I went and soaked a small towel in water and gently wiped the affected area, replacing the bandage with a new piece which I fastened in place with sticking plaster.

pg 145: The horror was so stupefying that they could do nothing but take helpless note of whatever they saw.

pg 151: And occasionally the shock of hitting the ground would do something to the joints of a corpse, so that it reminded me of Pinocchio, in the children's tale, with all the pins removed from his wooden limbs. If even Pinocchio, poor plaything of wood and metal pins, was supposed to have felt pain in his own wooden way when he barked his shin against something, what of those the dead, who had once been human beings?

pg 153: Perhaps he was afraid that, if he were to go looking for ashes and find corpses, it would wipe out forever the image of them he cherished. He too, like myself, must have seen enough of bodies, mangled, half-burned, and decomposing during the past few days.

pg 158: Every day on my way to work my eyes were delighted by the sight of crows settled on the dew-damp path between the fields. The glossy black sheen of crows' plumage in the morning blends well with the green of the rice plants, and equally well with the rice fields after they have started to turn yellow. The sight is indescribably pleasant at daybreak; on a really fine morning it is enough to set you heart beating faster.

pg 177: I recalled something that an agricultural expert visiting the village had once told us if rice in a paddy field was grown in water that was too deep, the part of the stem in contact with the water was weakened structurally, and the plant tended to topple over later. This, he said, was accepted scientific fact. But I had never heard anyone say that a sudden shock from light or sound or heat could set plants growing unusually fast. The bomb seemed to have encouraged the growth of plants and flies at the same time that it put a stop to human life.

pg 183: The piece of paper adjoining this once declared: "From Imperial Headquarters: (1) Yesterday, August 6, Hiroshima City suffered considerable damage as the result of an attack by a small number of enemy B-29 aircraft. (2) The enemy appears to have used a new type of bomb in this attack, but details are still under investigation."

pg 196: In the sky to the east, they could see a spreading black cloud. "I wonder what that is - a smoke screen from some maneuvuers, do you think?" her sister had sad. "IOf it's not, then it's something really big."

pg 257: "An atomic bomb," he said, his face pale from the effect of the drink. "that's the name for it, apparently. It gives off a terrific radiation. I myself saw some bricks in the ruins that were all burnt away, with bubbles raised on the surface. The tiles, too, had gone a kind of flame color. A terrible thing they've produced. They say nothing'll grow in Hiroshima or Nagasaki for another seventy-five years."
