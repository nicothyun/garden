popular defi use cases

payment rails like visa, paypal

**stablecoins:** a currency that isnt volatile in price that i can easily transact with. 
- not all stablecoins deploy the same mechanisms for pegging
- e.g DAI is a decentralized cryptocurrency collateralized stablecoins.
- e.g. USDC is a centralized, fiat collateralized stablecoin. if there is something that happens to USD, it will hurt USDC.
  

**lending and borrowing:** i want to earn interest on my crypto or take out a loan without an intermediary or complex terms. 
- first use case to take off. after purchasing crypto, you cannot do much with it except hold it until you are ready to sell. 
- money sitting in a bank account and not put to work is an opportunity loss even in tradfi. 
- lend crypto to earn interest. 

when you approve something, you are allowing the protocols to have access to your assets. REMOVE approvals after you are done. 

**cefi as use case:**
- cex operates via a single entity using their own software and system to match buy & ell orders (aka trades) 

**defi use cases:** 
- automated swaps by uniswap
- no KYC, cant be shut down, no single point of failure, and user owns assets 

exchanges: trade multiple currencies and tokens

**indexes:** own one token that represents a basket of multiple tokens to have financial 
- defi pulse index that tracks DeFi tokens and weighted based on the value of each token's circulating supply.
- also shows significant usage and show commitment to ongoing developments.
  
exposure to a category of many protocols

**staking:** lock up & deposit tokens
- stacking allows you to earn crypto for locking up your crypto. 
- users can participate in proof-of-stake consensus
- you can stake on a exchange, with a pool or alone

**derivatives as use case**
- essential to the crypto economy and are part of any mature financial system
- we need complex financial products to build a mature financial system and it supports making crypto as a recognized asset class
- creates more liquid markets = more capital in the markets and attracts more capital
- attracts more institutional and professional traders
- optimization of price discovery of assets by enabling investors to either go long or go short

**why defi?** 
1. it opens up access
2. allows for innovation in products
3. increased transparency

**defi approaches - trading** 
1. how do we create instruments? 

**defi approaches - (2) instruments**
- futures are great, but can have liquidity issues
- daily marigining is slow
- perpetual futures (refer to some external price) 
	- calculate a funding payment every x minutes/hours
	- can be traded on both CEX and DEX 
	-
beyond futures:
- options - buy or sell at some fixed price some time in the future
- defi products - squeeth, panoptic (options, built as a layer over AMM)

**use case: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**
- DAOs make decision using governance. governance is limited to token holders aka people who have financial skin in the game. 

collateralization
- borrower pledges an asset to secure a loan because in defi, there's no credit score or financial identity. 
- by borrowing instead of selling your ETH, you are able to obtain working capital without selling your assets. 
- selling your more volatile assets means closing your position. 

liquidity pools
- pools tokens into smart contracts and users lend, borrow, or trade against these liquidity pools. 
- pools can be shared across protocols, making the total liquidity across any of these platforms increase
- pools reduce risks of liquidity evaporating during a major negative event.
- protocols: uniswap, bancor, balancer, complexity.
