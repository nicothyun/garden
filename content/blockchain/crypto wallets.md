[Metamask, Brave, Backpack: The Crypto Wallets War is coming by Good Game Podcast ](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2xEABrLTv97v829xWIZzDL?si=4fa10eeefe254e61)
- Learn hoops and steps to use a wallet on crypto for early adopters - they are improving the curve now and also rewarded (with airdrops) for taking the operational risk
- Dilemma of security vs convenience
	- never use metamask's hot wallet because traded security for convenience
	- Pendle restaking on hardware wallet instead
- Various go to market strategy for crypto wallets
	- Extension distribution strategy - current norm now but thinks it is not the ideal even though it's normalized and assumed as the go-to-market for all crypto wallets
	- Clunky - have to download other extensions on top to detect scams and etc. e.g. WalletGuard
	- Eigenlayer as a distribution layer and strategy for security protocols building on top of Ethereum chain
	- Brave Wallet creates a wallet for all the main L1 and L2 chains for you - consolidates it? 
	- Thinks go-to-market for Brave is good 
- only 2-3 wallets will emerge as winners in this after mass adoption comes
- Verticalization of wallets: gaming, defi etc.
	- Gaming and Defi users are different because most gaming users prioritize convenience/UX over security versus Defi. 
- Wallet can become a major distribution strategy for apps 
- Crypto superapps with web2 version (Wechat) as an example? 
- Wallets can consider launching tokens in the future
