## What's DAI got to do with it?

## why we need stable cryptocurrencies?
- crypto vision is to replace fiat money globally as an everyday currency. fiat money is money accepted by a government but not backed by gold or other valuables. 
- but problem is cryptocurrency prices are volatile. 

**value of stablecoin's stability**
- solves daily volatility problem of digital assets
- maintains advantages of censorship resistant peer-to-peer digital transactions 
- option for avoiding inflationary fiat currencies
- can transact globally across borders
- drive the cost of money transfers to near zero. 
- holders don't have to use or sell assets with upside potential like ETH and BTC 
- value holds that of fiat currency, but can more easily be put to work

**so what?** 
- stablecoins have both the price stability of fiat currencies but the p2p nature of bitcoin and eth.

**use cases?**
- day to day **consumer use** as a medium of exchange
- **savings and earning interest** -> above average interest rates because of borrowing demand. e.g aave usdc get 4% interest rate. 
- **rewards** for gaming and credit cards 
- **royalties** - artists can earn recurring income on sales of NFTs in stablecoins
- **salaries** - pay employees in stablecoins that they can easily exchange to fiat 
- **remittances** 
- **hedging** as a safe harbour 

usdc market cap fell due to banking crisis in US, tether gained market share. 

**how does stablecoin stay stable?** 
- stablecoins are pegged 1:1 to an external asset or reference like the USD or EUR. 
- fiat pegged stablecoins and gold-backed stablecoins and backed by commodities. 
- not all stablecoins deploy the same mechanism for pegging. 

## stablecoin mechanics and collaterals 
**different mechanisms of pegging** (what they are backed by)
1. partially-backed - partially collateralized by crypto-assets and algorithmically stabilized.
2. commodity-backed - backed by physical assets such as precious metals, oil, and real estate.
	1. backed by fiat/commodity e.g. paypal usd
		1. for every stablecoin in circulation, there is one dollar in a bank account and are managed by a centralized entity and not by a blockchain protocol.
		2. central entity stores the cash you use to purchase the stablecoin and issues/redeems your stablecoins. 
		3. USDC stability is maintained by the US economy being stable. 
	2. **crypto-collateralized stablecoins**; backed by crypto; decentralized and live on blockchain where their stability is unmediated by any locality. 
		1. GHO stablecoin via the AAVE platform -> GHO is backed by tokens from individual users all over the world. 
		2. DAI stablecoin more suitable for institutions 
		3. decentralized, global and you can see 24h a day on what is backing the stablecoins - anyone can audit it
		4. Can be backed by tokens like ETH OR/and can be backed by multiple tokens or backed by a single token 
3. low volatility tokens - not designed to hold their price at $1 but rather programmed to float and change in value

**crypto-collateralized stablecoins**
- overcollateralized = your collateral value must be greater than your stablecoin loan. 
- overcollateralization keeps the whole system secure. 
- all stablecoin loans must be overcollateralized to de-risk volatility of assets. 

**GHO use case for crypto-collateralized stable-coin loans** 
![[screenshot of shefi course.png]]
- college students could take out loans for college using crypto holdings
- users in other developing countries where getting a loan is much harder, the appeal is higher to take a crypto loan.

## algorithmic stablecoins 
- **why so many algorithmic stablecoins have failed information and liquidity move too fast in?** the crypto space for it to be effective to back a stablecoin fully or partially with an algorithm
- with algorithmic stablecoins, the appeal was that it does not need to put collateral for loans. 
	- overcollateralized loans are imperfect. 

E.g. UST wasn't backed by a reserve of physical assets like some other stablecoins and was backed by LUNA. 
- In order for this system to work long term, there needs to be a high demand for UST & for LUNA. 
- Algorithmic stablecoins will only work if the system is inflated (demand)

**Failure of UST**
- Sharp decline in LUNA's price causes the supply of LUNA to fell and affected the UST peg.
- Loss of arbitrage efficiency
- Market panic cause significant sell-offs, leading to increased selling pressure on UST
- Decreased confidence about UST's stability
- Wiped out approx. $50b from the world. 
- Highly risky



stablecoins
- transparency and trust is important. 
-

e.g. Paypal USD is using Paxos -> PYUSD.
- Paxos cannot use customer assets (dollars) cannot be used to satisfy the debts of Paxos because client assets are held bankruptcy remote entity. 
- Value of PYUSD tokens are unaffected by bankruptcy. 



## silicon valley bank crisis and stablecoin losing peg (macro)
- failure of three US banks e.g SVB, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank caused both USDC and DAI to depeg from $1
- price has to fall to meet its backing. SVB is a reserve for USDC which cause the price of USDC to fall since $3.3 billion (on SVB) is missing from the backing. 

**what happened?** 
- circle and coinbase paused conversions between USDC and fiat $USD because if people keep selling USDC for cash, it removes even more cash from the reserves. 
- removing more cash from the reserves will cause the price to fall farther. 

## CBDC
- cbdc are digital currencies issued and regulated by a country's central bank. they represent a digital form of a country's official currency. 
- they are designed to work within a country's financial system. 

**cons of cbdc**
- (-) cash is the best way to have private transaction and to stay out of government's monitoring and are useful for all private transactions. but if there is no more cash and everything is digital, we will lose privacy. 
- (-) financial exclusion: those without access to technology may be excluded from the financial system
- (-) vulnerability to cybersecurity risks 


## key takeaways of stablecoins
- stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable price by linking their price to some external asset or reference. 
- what is their mechanisms
- whenever you are examining a stablecoin, you need to check what they are backed by and how does that impact their risk profile
