Social networks are p2p mediums of information exchange, operated by centralized platforms which intermediate the exchange via platform rules and algorithms. 

a social graph maps out the digital relationships between people and the content you interact with
- graph as a set of objects with some interrelationship
- it serves a vital role in building feed algorithms which show you interesting content

## problem of web2 social platforms
- they are closed ecosystems so all our interactions happen in each individual ecosystem 
	- our data and interactions cannot be ported over
	- permission is needed for developers to build on the network
	- significant barriers for new competition
	- leaving and switching costs are high for users where the goal is to keep us on a singular problem.
- second problem: web2 social companies own your content 
- web2 social companies tech stack is centralized
- web2 social companies are extractive where their business model all but requires harvesting of user data to give up advertising and subscription revenue.
- problem of internet then: they didnt know how to monetize the internet (dotcom era burst)

## what happens to the creator economy? 

- creator economy is both the creators and the platforms that support creation and connection
- largely exists and rely on web2 social media platforms.
- there's a platform creator mismatch where platform has more power over creators
- creators are left behind
- we want to own the things we create and build

**web3 social as a solution**
- community and creator driven where users are in control of their data, creations, relationships and monetization

**what is web3 social**
1. decentralized where network is reliable and persistent
2. permissionless - open access
3. user-governed

web3 social inherits properties of blockchain which helps it redesign better systems:
- censorship resistant 
- smart contracts 

**ENS DAO**
