@sagaxyz__ community notes tl:dr

1. saga origins - publishing arm
2. meta - bringing in other communities like DAO, nft communities

one chain runs into congestion issues, traffic spikes and all trxns slow down but if they go through, gas fee is high and variable - suboptimal. 
- modularity tries to solve that. take all the components of the chain and break it down
- modular maxi approach makes it incredibly hard for developers because they need to deal with XX options to integrate
- saga gives you a chain out of box (a stripe for web3 gaming???) to focus on scale. 
- chose to focus on gaming & entertainment for scalability (users)


how to make it easier for devs to build for both blockchain and non-blockchain familiar technology
