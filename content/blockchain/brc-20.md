- BRC-20 was launched in March 2023 by pseudonymous developer [Domo](https://twitter.com/domodata). 
	- Meant to be an fun experimental standard to create off-chain balance states with inscriptions.
- BRC-20 allowed users to create Bitcoin-native fungible tokens but it led to excessive production of "junk" UTXOs, which clogged networks.
- Uses Bitcoin ordinal inscriptions instead of relying on smart contracts 
	- Ordinal theory concerns itself with satoshis, giving them individual identities and allowing them to be tracked, transferred and imbued with meaning.

	- misnomer in naming? unlike ERC-20, it lacks support for smart contracts.
