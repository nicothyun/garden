- Runes are fungible tokens issued directly on Bitcoin using the Runes protocol. 
- Proposed by Casey Rodarmor (creator of Ordinals)
- Doesn't require off-chain data or a native token to operate 
- Bitcoin Runes' onchain data storage is in the OP_RETURN part of a transaction. (like a post it on the transaction book)
- Runes is compatible with Lightning Network to enable faster and cheaper transactions.
