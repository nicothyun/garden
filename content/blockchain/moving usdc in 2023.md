1. i move my usdc from CB Centralized Wallet 
2. moved native USDC to CB web3 wallet using Base network
3. bridge ETH ETH to ETH Base on CB web3 wallet 
4. swap native USDC on CB web3 wallet to USDBC because alot of the Dapps dont support or recognize native USDC on Base network yet V.S USDbc. maybe not much liquidity yet since Circle just introduced native USDC on Base. 
5. after i have USDbC, i use stargate finance to bridge USDbc to USDC polygon and send directly to based wallet address.
6. Yay, i finally have USDC in my based wallet. I swap USDC to XSGD.

**date: 13/10/2023**

i paid a total of $2.60 USD in network fees and 1 xsgd in straitx usdc-xsgd swap.
