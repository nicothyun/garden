[[lombok strait]]: south of lombok, near kuta

**places to go/went** **& experienced
- [mana yoga](https://manalombok.com/), ashtanga yoga sore
- full moon soundbath yoga
- bat cave, mawan beach 
- mt rinjani trekking 
- lanne beach / pantai selong belanak for beginner surfing 
- secret gilis tour - gilli naggu, gilii kedis and gili sudak at south-west lombok (!!! very beautiful beaches and cerulean blue waters)

**loose observations**
- tourism as main income. exploitative in a way and makes locals increasingly dependent and sometimes almost parasitic to tourists for survival.
- most prices are standardized across tours/airport shuttles/massages/scooter rentals.
	- probably there is an co-ordinated group (i.e national kuta transport association) setting prices across the warungs and locals. it's good because grab & gojek or apps can't undercut them as much? 
- lots of trucks to maintain, build and destroy roads in lombok. roads for bikes & cars are better built and maintained here than in phuket.
	- could be cause motorbiking races and competitions provide added income sources for lombok.(appended on 10/20/23: realized there was a motorbiking competition happening) 
- mosques are more common than in bali. balinese hinduism penetration is so high, that islam is unable to penetrate through?
- small tiny four tatami space kind of wood houses and brick houses (if brick, it is likely damaged and requires repairs) without beds by the kuta beach. locals on hard floor, and go out to fish in the morning.
- locals outside of tourists spots are very friendly and kids are excited to meet tourists/foreigners.
