nihon ga 日本画 - genre by a traditional technique from the start of the Meiji era (India ink and colours over paper and silk) v.s. to yo-ga (japanese western style) (oil paintings over canvas)  
  
some interesting pieces:  
Yasuda yukihiko (1884-1978) 一茶  
  
seiichi horiuchi - children book illustrations. his drawing and sketching reminds me a lot of my inner life that I didn't know how to elucidate or captures. he draws from the pov of the animals, flying across walls and etc. no photos allowed but walking through the special exhibition made me feel like a child again.  
  
saw up several manet, picasso, renoir pieces up close without the crowd
