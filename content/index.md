hello internet wanderer, you have stumbled to my public garden of thought. this abode is messy, chaotic and probably would not make much sense to a stranger but it is where i explore, prune and gather my curiosities into an interconnected map. think of this as my PKM. 

grammar edits and incongruence are aplenty. 

## Interests

- #natural-history
- technology as a tool ([[techno-optimism]])
- tourism and #travel 
- #fringe-theories #conspiracy-theories as alternative modes of thinking and different paradigm to continually calibrate & challenge my current paradigm or mental modes 
- video painting  
- philosophy
