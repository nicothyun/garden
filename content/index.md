Hello internet wanderer, you have stumbled to my public garden of thought. This abode is messy, chaotic and probably would not make much sense to a stranger but it is where I explore, prune and gather my curiosities into an interconnected map. Think of this as my PKM. 

Grammar edits, spelling errors and incongruence are aplenty.

- #fringe-theories (conspiracy theories) as alternative modes of thinking and different paradigm to continually calibrate & challenge my current paradigm or mental modes
