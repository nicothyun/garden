hello internet wanderer, you have stumbled to my public garden of thought. this adobe is messy, chaotic and probably would not make much sense to a stranger but it is where i explore, prune and gather my curiosities into a interconnected map. 

**current areas of interests:** 
- building my [[notetaking process]]  
- reading and consolidating them into [[book notes]]
