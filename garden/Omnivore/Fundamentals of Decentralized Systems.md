## Highlights

> I'd argue that consensus on globally shared state is implicitly a fundamental property of modern blockchain-based decentralized systems. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fundamentals-of-decentralized-systems-18deb498f9f#c6f04015-4731-4d64-8dff-70be13bac5c2)  ^c6f04015

> Decentralization is a property that can exist without consensus protocols but it's more meaningful in systems that have globally shared state. Modern decentralized systems, at least in the crypto industry, implicitly assume that when we say decentralized system it means a decentralized system with globally shared state.

> I believe that open membership is a fundamental property of modern decentralized systems [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fundamentals-of-decentralized-systems-18deb498f9f#6b8e2115-69d7-46a4-9a19-8fcd43595cba)  ^6b8e2115

> These systems argue for keeping as much data outside of the blockchain as possible. [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/fundamentals-of-decentralized-systems-18deb498f9f#87d0cc65-553b-406e-9de9-c8585355b7d6)  ^87d0cc65
