## Highlights

> By contrast, to be at leisure is to be free to pursue studies and activities aimed at the cultivation of virtue (such as music, poetry and philosophy). These are properly the ends of noble leisure.

> What Aristotle appears to have in mind is “the leisure worthy of a really free man, such as he attains when his political duties have been performed, or such as he already possesses, provided he is financially independent and leads a life of true study or contemplation” [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/the-noble-leisure-project-aristotle-on-work-vs-leisure-18b5d06d108#0a17caea-fb91-4160-8115-d94e48170286)  ^0a17caea
