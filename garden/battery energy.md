battery energies are moving from lithium-ion to solid-state batteries, they are a form of new energy away from fossil fuels, 
[[clean(er) energy]]

different batteries technologies:
1. solid-state batteries (i.e employed by quantamscape - no fully working protocol yet as of now)
2. sodium-ion batteries (i.e CATL, chinese battery giant)
3. stationary storage via iron-air (i.e Form Energy)

some startups: 
- Sila, partnering with Mercedes-Benz to produce materials for EV batteries starting in 2025. 

macro: 
- more funds and loans/grants to battery makers in US through IRA 

economics of batteries:
- it is a cost game. game to further eke out greater performance at lower costs

**curiosities and qns:** 
1. find out what is solid state batteries or solid state technology  
2. what makes up a battery fundamentally
