Schopenhauer suggests that modern life, fast paced overstimulated nature prevents us from experiencing true happiness instead of the illusions we mistake for happiness like wealth and status. He argued that we should strive to simplify our lives and avoid unnecessary distractions.

Pleasure of will & pleasure of intellect.

Pleasures of will as a lower kind where pleasures like this are fleeting and ultimately unsatisfying as they fail to provide lasting happiness.

Pleasures of intellect come from contemplating art, philosophy and science. pleasures are superior to the will and provide a sense of lasting fulfillment. Intellectual pleasures are more accessible - cheap and donâ€™t depend on external circumstances.
